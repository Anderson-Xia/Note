# EnFuzz: Ensemble Fuzzing with Seed Synchronization among Diverse Fuzzers

---

## Motivation

---

In real world application (`Especially Industrial Environment`), the performance of those well-designed fuzzing strategies is challenged by complex implementation. 
Specific fuzzers which focus on particular issue may perform not so effective. 

For the reason above, this work tries to achieve ensemble fuzzing with diverse fuzzer so that we can utilize the advantages of different fuzzer to solve real world problem.

Here is an example:

## Insight

 This work synchronizes the seeds used in different fuzzers with a Global Asynchronous and Local Synchronous method, showing as the figure 2 below:
 
![figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anderson-Xia/Note/main/2021_11_9/img/2021110901.png)

There is a global monitor which maintains the global coverage that stands for the union of all fuzzers, it periodically synchronizes the seeds which cover new branch or result in crash to the individual local seed pools of all fuzzers.
